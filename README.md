# Pomodoro Together

A social pomodoro app for productivity. Create Pomodoro sessions which friends
can join to use as a synchronized work timer.

This is a WIP app, I will continue to develop this app when I have the
time/motivation. It's currently an MVP with most functionality implemented, but
not very styled or customizable.
